Description

This is the second of six projects necessary for Udacity's Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree. In this project, I have created a simple, one page responsive website using
HTML5, CSS4, and Bootstrap. During this project I learned a great deal about how to properly structure and style a webpage while keeping constant with the "mobile-first" 
paradigm. For this page to be operational, the files will have to be installed and ran locally. 

Installation Instructions

1 git clone https://github.com/nxl904/ud_Portfolio
2 cd ud_Portfolio

Usage
Once all of the files are copied from git to your local, you'll need to open the Portfolio_LoGalbo.html file, and the site will render on your defaulted browser.
